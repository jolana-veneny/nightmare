# Nightmare: Ropped and Screwed

Nightmare is an Intro to Binary Exploitation / Reverse Engineering course based around Capture the Flag challenges [available here](https://github.com/guyinatuxedo/nightmare) created by GuyInATuxedo. It was named Nightmare by GuyInATuxedo because it's a lot of peoples' nightmare to get hit by weaponized 0days. The skills taught in this course directly translate into doing that type of work. (Additionally, Nightmare is [a really cool song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94bGzWyHbu0)).

A nod to the ["chopped and screwed"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chopped_and_screwed) genre pioneered by DJ Screw, this is a slowed-down remix of the Nightmare course. This course is entirely derived from the hard work GuyInATuxedo put in, Roppers just added a bit more of a focus on theory, repeating critical ideas, and slowly building expertise in alignment with the [Roppers](https://roppers.org) philosophy. There are also files from other courses I love, specifically [Adam Aviv's SI485H](https://github.com/adamaviv/si485h-f18). To be extremely clear, I didn't do much and all credit goes to these folks.

I made this remix because I spend a lot of time teaching people Binary Exploitation and while I tell everyone Nightmare is the best course, I found myself supplementing the material with external links. This is my attempt to make a unified repo that has everything needed for a beginner to do a fully self-taught journey into binary exploitation expertise.

## What Makes Nightmare Different?
`From GuyInATuxedo`

There are a lot of resources out there to learn binary exploitation / reverse engineering skills, so what makes this different?

```
*    Amount of Content             -    There is a large amount of content in this course (currently over 90 challenges), laid out in a linear fashion.

*    Well Documented Write Ups         -    Each challenge comes with a well documented writeup explaining how to go from being handed the binary to doing the exploit dev.

*    Multiple Problems per Topic     -    Most modules have multiple different challenges. This way you can use one to learn how the attack works, and then apply it to the others. Also different iterations of the problem will have knowledge needed to solve it.

*    Uses all open source tools     -    All the tools used here are free and open sourced. No IDA torrent needed.

*    A Place to Ask Questions         -    So if you have a problem that you've been working for days and can't get anywhere (and google isn't helping).
```

I have found that resources that have many of these things to be few and far between. As a result it can make learning these skills difficult since you don't really know what to learn, or how to learn it. This is essentially my attempt to help fix some of those problems.
